# Emergent Gravity from a Casimir-Constrained Superfluid Vacuum

**Abstract:** A brief summary of the core finding (the CMB prediction) and the foundational premise (Casimir/Superfluid Vacuum).

## 1. Foundational Premises
The model is built on two simple, coupled observations:

* **P1. Spacetime Creation Source:** The only real candidate for continuously creating new space (which drives cosmic expansion) is **quantum vacuum fluctuations (quantum foam)**.
* **P2. The Casimir Constraint:** The Casimir effect is essentially **blind to gravitational curvature**. This implies that the rate of spacetime creation ($\Gamma$), sourced by vacuum energy, must itself be a function of local curvature ($R$), otherwise the vacuum would be fundamentally non-uniform everywhere.

**Conclusion:** Gravity is an emergent phenomenon: **Curvature $R$ dictates the local spacetime creation rate $\Gamma$, and the radial flow of this new spacetime is experienced as gravity.**

## 2. Galactic Dynamics (The $10^{30}$ Problem)
Simple linear coupling ($\Gamma \propto \Gamma_0 + \kappa R$) was tested and failed, as the cosmological background rate ($\Gamma_0 \approx 4 \times 10^{-37} \text{ s}^{-1}$) overwhelms the local galactic curvature term by a factor of $\sim 10^{30}$, resulting in no observable modification to Newtonian dynamics.

* **Resolution:** To explain galactic rotation curves (e.g., MOND-like dynamics), the model must adopt a **non-linear, Stiff Superfluid Vacuum** framework (analogous to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation). This rigidity effectively screens the cosmological background $\Gamma_0$ in local, curved regions, allowing the local curvature $R$ to dominate and generate the required long-range force.

## 3. The Principle of Cosmological Identity
A key consequence of the superfluid model is that the maximum density and energy state of spacetime is universal:

* The **primitive pre-universe state** (Planck/QCD era) and the **interior of a regularized black hole** (replacing the singularity) are physically **identical**. Both represent the condition where the vacuum is compressed to its maximum (Planck-scale) density, forcing maximum, turbulent spacetime creation ($\Gamma_{\max}$).

## 4. The Testable Scientific Prediction
The hypothesis that the early universe plasma was a superfluid has a direct, observable consequence:

* **Hypothesis:** The cosmic plasma during the **QCD Phase Transition** ($T \approx 100-150 \text{ MeV}$) existed as a **dense, turbulent superfluid vortex tangle**. 
* **Prediction:** The subsequent reconnections and decay of this turbulence should have left a unique, indelible imprint on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies.
* **Signature:** This signal is predicted to be a **non-Gaussian** signal with a dominant **Vector-mode (B-mode) polarization** contribution, peaked at angular multipoles specifically in the range **$\ell \approx 800–2500$**.
* **Action:** This signature represents a novel template for searches using high-resolution CMB data (e.g., from CMB-S4), providing a key opportunity to falsify the Vortical Cosmology paradigm.
